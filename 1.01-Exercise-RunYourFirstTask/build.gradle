Welcome to the first exercise in ud867! Have fun, and remember that you can
always check out the solution.gradle file for help!

In this simple Gradle build script we have defined a single task named
"hello". As you can see, the task's action simply prints the string "Hello
World" to the standard output.

Since we haven't installed Gradle yet, we'll execute this task using the
Gradle wrapper. The wrapper is a script that will download and install a
specified version of Gradle.

Remember that you can always look at the solution.gradle file for help!

Challenges:
  1. Find the solution.gradle file in this directory.
  2. Use the Gradle wrapper to execute the task "hello".
  3. Modify the action of this task so it instead prints your name.
  4. Figure out my favorite type of candy.

REMEMBER: This build script delegates the already built-in project object
*/

task hello {  // This is a configuration closure; it delegates the task object

    // These are function calls which set the value of the attributes
    // with the same exact name, i.e. description is a setter for the
    // description attribute
    description "Hey student! Run this one :D"
    group "Our Demos"
    
    // List of actions the task will perform
    doLast {  // This is a closure
        // println "Hello World!"
        println "My name is Rishit."
    }
}
